## Data
The data is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/snipsco/nlu-benchmark/tree/master/2017-06-custom-intent-engines).It contains various user queries categorized into seven intents.
Here are the intents:

    SearchCreativeWork (e.g. Find me the I, Robot television show)
    GetWeather (e.g. Is it windy in Boston, MA right now?)

    RateBook (e.g. Give 6 stars to Of Mice and Men)
    SearchScreeningEvent (e.g. Check the showtimes for Wonder Woman in Paris) 
## Preprocessing
Following preprocessing was performed on the text data:
- Stopwords Removal
- Noise Removal
- Accented Words Removal
- Lemmatization
## Modeling
### Machine Learning Method
- [Random Forests](https://github.com/Neha1529/Intent_Recognition/blob/master/model.py)
### Deep Learning Method
- [Bi-Directional LSTM](https://github.com/Neha1529/IntentRecognition/blob/master/Intent_recognition_using_LSTM.ipynb)
## How to Run 
1. Install Docker
2. Pull docker image from the [registry](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/neha2915/flask-app) by the command
    **docker pull neha2915/flask-app:intentimage**
3. Run the image by the command **docker run --name (name the container) -p 80:80 neha2915/flask-app:intentimage**
4. To view the output,on your browser go to **localhost:80** or **(ip-address of docker machine):80**
